      Throughout each term our chapter holds various events that are open to the student body. Our most common event is our Thursday night "AD" dinner. AD dinner is a very entertaining event that occurs every Thursday throughout our school term. The event is formal and open to all students. During the event we play music through our speaker system and serve refreshments. A few brothers spend the night cooking a delicious meal that we serve at midnight. Another common event is our Open mic night at the chapter house. We usually have an open mic once a term with other campus organizations. We provide the necessary equipment for students to perform along with a stage to perform on. Food and refreshments are served and students are allowed to perform two-three songs.
