      <p class='aboutus'>
            Union College is world-famous as the Mother of Fraternities, home to the first Greek letter secret society (Kappa Alpha) founded at Union College in 1825, as well as home to several national fraternities founded at Union in the early 1830’s. In 1833, a secret “Fraternal Society” was organized Union; therein the Union Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi saw its its basic beginning. The Fraternal Society enjoyed a reputation for the moral and intellectual worth of its members. The Society realized the benefits to be derived from affiliation with the leading national fraternity and the members believed the aims and principles of Alpha Delta Phi were what they desired. Consequently, early in 1859, one tutor and 16 undergraduates signed a petition for a Union Chapter.

            On June 14, a Charter signed by Richard Salter Storrs, then President of the Fraternity, was granted. Soon after, the Chapter was duly instituted, with representatives from nearly all the chapters present at the inauguration of the Union Chapter. The first meeting was held on July 15, 1859, and with the establishment of the Chapter, the Fraternity Society ceased to exist at Union College. For several years, AD’s occupied a floor of rooms in the Stockade, but by 1892 conditions had reached the point that the Union Association of the Alpha Delta Phi (the Chapter’s Alumni Association) formed and began fundraising for the purpose of building a house on campus. A site at 3 Library Lane had been negotiated with the College, and famed local architect Albert W. Fuller was hired. Fuller designed a three-story, 9500 square foot, brick mansion in a “friendly” Colonial Revival-style – a very early example of the architectural style that was to dominate the first half of the 20th century American building, and perhaps also an attempt to attract prospective wealthy incoming southern scholars to the post-civil-war north.

            The Chapter House was clad in gold tapestry brick and featured a wrap around porch and huge columns with Corinthian capitals. The final construction cost was approximately $12,000. The main floor was basically a 50’ x 50’ square, configured with four large rooms – an entry room & living room with large fireplaces, a library and mahogany-paneled dining room; the second floor had four bedrooms (The Grange, Frustration’s Haven, Ice Box & Executive Suite); and the top floor had two (Hell’s Kitchen & “The Don’t Worry Club”). Each bedroom consisted of a large common area/sitting room and an inner room with 3 beds, 3 desks & 3 floor-to-ceiling closets. At the back of the house was the first floor kitchen, with bathrooms and servant’s quarters {Mabel’s & Mabel’s Annex} above. According to oral tradition, the Chapter house was finished 1898. However, the Union College website includes quotes from “Mrs. Perkins’ Garden,” (a campus journal from the time), which indicate that the Chapter house was substantially completed and livable by 1895, and fully completed by 1896. 
            Strategically located at #3 Library Lane on the campus’ main entry, sited between the famous Payne Gate and the Nott Memorial Library, the Union Chapter House was the second fraternity house built on the Union campus, and remains as one of the few original fraternity houses still standing at Union.  Many interior improvements were added in the early 20th century commemorating the achievements of illustrious Chapter Alumni, include the Charles Edwin Angle mahogany-paneled dining room, and the Harman Whartman Veeder and the _________ _________ carved oak fireplace mantles, both of which have been removed and reinstalled in the current Chapter House.

            A rigorous program of maintenance kept the Chapter house a handsome and viable abode throughout the 20th century, with a special focus from 1980 – 1995 by the alumni and active brothers who worked closely to maintain and improve the house. Upgrades to the Chapter House during this time included installation of a new roof & roof rail; new back stairs, new basement stairs and new bulkhead; wiring upgrades; major structural reinforcement & rebuild of the front stairwell; renovation of the kitchen, washroom, ladies’ room, shower room & 4-hole; flooring replacement & hardwood resurfacing, renovation of Frustration’s Haven & the adjoining 2nd story porch; and a major rebuild of the massive front porch, deck, rails & huge columns. Through these efforts, by 1995 Alpha Delta Phi was the only Fraternity at Union that still owned, managed and operated a functioning Chapter House.

            In the early days, the active Chapter numbered between fifteen and twenty. The membership stabilized at around twenty-five, though at times it ran over thirty. During World War I the exodus of Brothers to enlist left only four members, who constituted the entire active Chapter. In World War II the Chapter House was rented to the College for use by civilian students and it’s gold exterior was painted olive drab. The nature of accelerated college training with a rapid turnover of students made it advisable in 1943 to declare the Chapter inactive for the duration of the war. In an effort to overcome these problems and reorganize the Chapter at the end of the conflict, in 1944 the Trustees pledged two sons of members, initiating them soon afterwards. A few Alumni held frequent meetings with the initiates for indoctrination and November 4, 1945 the Chapter was formally reactivated, and within one year had a membership of over thirty Brothers.

            The Union Chapter remained strong through the 1950’s to the middle 1960’s, but, like many Fraternities across the country, suffered a decline in members during the era of Cultural Revolution and student rebellion; the AD presence at Union began to fade with only sixteen Brothers by 1974.  But through renewed effort, membership doubled to over thirty Brothers by 1979.  In the 1980’s and 90’s, the House became a center of social life on campus, perhaps due to the combination of 1) legal drinking age increased to twenty-one; 2) decline of Union’s Rathskellar, and 3) the nature of the AD basement – a large, private, virtually indestructible social area with taps and pong tables – which resulted in Alpha Delta Phi becoming the prime social destination for relaxing after studies. Suffice it to say that when academics in the Schaffer Library study area winded-down at midnight, the AD basement came to life.

            In 1995 Union College announced its campus “Master Plan,” intent upon the reorganization of the Greek System at Union. Perhaps the most egregious aspect was the plan to take #3 Library Lane from the Fraternity and reuse the Chapter House as office space. The College claimed that actually, it only wanted the site – not the Chapter House. But when Alumni solicited a house moving contractor, verified a suitable new location on campus land, and offered to move the Chapter House (off Library Lane) and to relinquish just the vacant site, the college immediately built new tennis courts on said suitable vacant land.  Thereafter, Trustees and active alumni litigated, worked and negotiated with the College tirelessly for several years. In 1999, Trustees reached a favorable agreement with Union to turn-over #3 Library Lane in exchange for Fero House – an excellent old campus house (circa 1860), privately sited on beautiful Jackson’s Gardens – with the stipulations that the school construct an additional wing onto Fero House for dining and ceremonial uses, and further, that if the Alpha Delta Phi should, for any reason, no longer occupy Fero House, a payment of $300,000 would be made to the Union Association. 
            Fero House had been the 19th century home of the caretaker for Jackson’s Gardens. In the 1890’s the house suffered from a blaze and required the rebuilding of the entire interior.  During the mid-20th century, Fero served as Chapter House for the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. In the 1980’s the College reclaimed and reimagined Fero, first as a coffee house/social spot for students, and later, as administrative offices. Neither use was a “good fit” for Fero.

            After several years without a true home, living and gathering in off-campus apartments, the brothers finally moved into Fero House in 2001. A large dining room and expanded kitchen had been added to the building along with the Whartman-Veeder and _____________ _______________ fireplace mantles.  In 2006, the actives and Alumni Association dedicated the Kenneth J. Conklin Commemorative Library on the first floor of Fero House, complete with bookshelves and fireplace. Recent House improvements by actives, alumni & Associate Members include building a stereo cabinet (2007); renovating the “Adelphian” service bar (2010), renovating & refinishing the original dining tables from Library Lane (2011), constructing a modular stage system (2012), constructing Adirondack-style bench seating (2013) and a large latticework adorned with a shield containing “1859” and the Star & Crescent (2014) on the front porch, and the construction of Star & Crescent speaker enclosures and renovation of the stereo cabinet (2015).
