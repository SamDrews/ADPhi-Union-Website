            <p class='gen-history'>
                Alpha Delta Phi was founded in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York by Samuel Eells 
                (1810-1842). Founded as a literary society, it evolved into one of the most distinguished of the 
                original American college fraternities. It has retained its focus on its literary roots, by 
                attracting only the best students at only the best colleges and universities in Canada and the 
                United States. Our chapters are leaders on their respective campuses, where some of our chapter 
                houses have been designated architectural or historic landmarks. The Alpha Delta Phi experience has 
                helped a disproportionate number of its 50,000 lifelong members to become top leaders in industry, 
                government, education, and religion.

                Samuel Eells, the provident founder of The Alpha Delta Phi, most eloquently expressed the principal 
                purpose of the fraternity. It was his intent that “this new association, with a true philosophical 
                spirit, looking to the entire man, develop his whole being—moral, social and intellectual.” Since 
                its beginning at Hamilton College in 1832, The Alpha Delta Phi has sought to provide a 
                comprehensive growth experience for young men at leading universities and colleges in Canada and 
                the United States.

                As lifelong members of a fraternal brotherhood, Brothers unite to participate in an atmosphere of 
                energetic and concerted interaction where the moral, social and intellectual aspects of each man’s 
                character may grow and flourish. Special importance is attached to five areas: enhancing personal 
                self esteem; promoting constructive respect and caring for others with diverse backgrounds and 
                personalities; developing leadership qualities and self discipline; improving scholastic and 
                literary skills; and serving the school and community.

                Fraternity involvement is characterized by undertaking responsibilities within a group of peers 
                while at the same time having contact with interested alumni. This process enhances individual 
                self-respect as well as fostering responsible concern for others within the chapter. 
                The Fraternity’s tradition is to seek members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, interests and 
                skills. In this climate, each Brother develops an appreciation of those different from himself and 
                comes to understand how the viewpoints of others can enrich his own life.

                In addition to chapter-oriented activities, Brothers are encouraged to undertake projects that 
                benefit both school and community. Along with the additional growth in group skills, each Brother 
                comes to appreciate the personal and societal rewards associated with contributing to a larger 
                community. Standards of behavior and achievement are not rigidly imposed; however, excellence is 
                strongly encouraged. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on brotherhood and blending one’s 
                personal interests with those of the chapter. The Alpha Delta Phi has many programs and activities 
                directed toward helping chapters and individual Brothers set objectives and realize their goals.

                Many special benefits accrue to members of The Alpha Delta Phi. The most obvious and immediate is 
                the unique opportunity for a practical leadership experience while learning to work harmoniously 
                within a group. Over a longer horizon, there is the joy of lifelong friendships with men who hold 
                similar aims and ideals. Many of these friendships span age differences. Undergraduate Brothers 
                often receive their first introduction to a profession or a business career through successful 
                alumni who have had similar experiences. And later on, interested alumni may also foster leadership 
                qualities in the next generation through their participation in chapter advisory boards and in 
                regional activities.
