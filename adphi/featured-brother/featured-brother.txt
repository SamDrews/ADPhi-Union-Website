Peter has been a very active volunteer since his junior fall semester term abroad in Vietnam. During his time in Vietnam, he worked with Think Playgrounds to construct a playground out of donated recycled material for the children of Hanoi. He personally volunteers at Girls Inc, Kenney Community Center, and for various fundraisers. As Philanthropy chair of Alpha Delta Phi he has greatly increased our philanthropy involvement with the local community. Last spring, he introduced our chapter to volunteering at a community farm called Vale Urban Farm. The farm is brand new and located at the Vale Schenectady cemetery. The farm allows for the local community to grow and harvest fruits and vegetables. The farm is completely non-profit and for the benefit of the community. Peter introduced our chapter to the farm in the spring when it was completely empty flat land. Since then, we have volunteered as a brotherhood every week during our time at school in the spring and fall terms. The farm has grown into a very large well-kept farm and is now in its final stages of the harvesting season. Brother Peterâ€™s efforts have offered great value to the community and given our chapter a wonderful chance to grow as a brotherhood.
